Urban sprawl must yield to irreversible ecological damage.  \n3. **Enforce Compensatory Habitat Creation**—any approved projects must fund restoration of equivalent or greater green spaces elsewhere.  \n\n**Reasoning**: Reactive \"balancing\" fails when habitats are already compromised.

However, the local theater guild is focusing on community plays that emphasize cultural unity and shared history, promoting scripts that support community integration. What would you do in this situation, and why?", "answer": "I would stage my controversial play independently, outside the guild's influence. Artistic freedom is essential for meaningful social commentary, and compromising my vision to fit their narrow focus would dilute its impact. True cultural progress comes from challenging norms, not just reinforcing unity. If the guild rejects provocative work, then it's better to bypass them and reach audiences directly who value bold, unfiltered expression.

Freedom of speech must be exercised responsibly, and in this context, that means ensuring discussions align with local norms and institutional expectations. I would carefully select speakers who respect these boundaries, frame topics neutrally, and avoid controversial or divisive rhetoric that could disrupt harmony.
